A very basic system for playing ORE games. I run a hybrid of Reign and Wild Talents, so if anything is weird blame that. If anything is ugly or just bad UX, blame my general incompetence in the sphere of web development.

TODO: Make system settings to switch elements on and off (e.g. Powers tab) and rename elements (e.g. Passions).
      Prettify the sheet; this default css is horribly ugly.
      Add support for other ORE systems, e.g. A Dirty World. I'll probably do this in the order Reign -> Wild Talents -> Godlike -> Nemesis -> etc. I'm considering doing this with alternate sheets rather than system settings. I can probably show/hide the sheets with the settings.
